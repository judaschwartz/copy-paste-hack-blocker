# copy-paste-hack-blocker
This is a Chrome plugin that protects the browser from the copy paste hack that is shown here https://marco97pa.github.io/copy-paste-hack-js/

By default a confirmation dialogue will be displayed if the copied text is different than the selected text the user can change the setting to have the copy be auto corrected without confirmation.
